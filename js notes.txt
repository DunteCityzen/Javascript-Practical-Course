DOM - Document Object Model

This was just introduced to make javascript to be able to interact with an HTML document

In javascript conditional statements, we use === (three equal signs instead of 2) to make sure we use a more strict comparison(data-type sensitive)

Today I'm going to look at how to convert strings to integers and find a better input type to use for numbers.
	To convert a string to an integer, we use an inbuilt function called parseInt() which takes in the string we want to convert as the argument.
	Additionally we can add the base as the second argument but by default it's 10 which refers to decimal no. base.

	To convert into a float value, the function here is parseFloat()
