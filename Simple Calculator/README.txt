Make sure to open in full screen
Browser in full screen mode

This is to avoid some visibility issues as the css wasn't made to be variable with the browser's screen size
rather fixed measurements of the elements were used.

So make sure you open it in full screen mode

and feel free to improve on my terrible CSS, LOL.

The course was rather intended on learning Javascript so I didn't care much about the styling, hence my terrible UI.
