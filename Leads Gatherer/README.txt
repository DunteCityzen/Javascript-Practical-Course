New to using Leads Gatherer?

No worries.

	** How to Get it onto your Chrome Browser**
* You can get it from Chrome's Web Store ( Advised )
	OR
 pull/get it and load it locally. (Check how to do this online(google or chatGPT away)

This is an easy to use open source Chrome extension, built to help:
    sales representatives,
    marketing teams,
    and any other user who intends to gather links
 as they traverse the web for leads or any other interesting information.

 A user is able to quickly note down the lead or interesting info without leaving the browser.

It is also possible to just quickly note the link in the browser's tab that you're on by using SAVETAB button.

Once enough links are gathered, you can copy them and now transfer them holistically to an excel spreadsheet, pdf, docx file etc.
The leads don't get lost upon page refresh, browser close or even a shutdown. 
This is because the leads are persisted through the above mentioned actions.
Therefore, if you want to clear all the information collected, this can be done by using the CLEAR button

This being the first version of the extension, there's room for improvements.
Updates will be made periodically depending on insights I get, demands from my cherished users.
So please bear with me in the meantime, and if you have any suggestions, feel free to email me at:
